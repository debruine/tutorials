Set the argment to the path where you want to save your package. The last section of the path should be the name of the package. usethis::create_package(&quot;~/rstuff/demopckg&quot;) Package names can only be letters, numbers, and full stops. You'll see the following output, and a new RStudio project will open up. You can close the old window now and just work in this project. ✔ Setting active project to &#39;~/rstuff/demopckg&#39; ✔ Creating &#39;R/&#39; ✔ Creating &#39;man/&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;DESCRIPTION&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;NAMESPACE&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;demopckg.Rproj&#39; ✔ Adding &#39;.Rproj.user&#39; to &#39;.gitignore&#39; ✔ Adding &#39;^demopckg\\\\.Rproj$&#39;, &#39;^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$&#39; to &#39;.Rbuildignore&#39; ✔ Opening new project &#39;demopckg&#39; in RStudio 1.3.1 Edit the DESCRIPTION file Open the DESCRIPTION file. It should look like this: Package: demopckg Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case) Version: 0.0.0.9000 Authors@R: person(given = &quot;First&quot;, family = &quot;Last&quot;, role = c(&quot;aut&quot;, &quot;cre&quot;), email = &quot;first.last@example.com&quot;) Description: What the package does (one paragraph). License: What license it uses Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true Change the title, authors, and description to your own information. If your package has multiple authors, add them as a vector like this. You can also add your ORCiD.

You can install the released version of demopckg from [GitHub](https://github.com) with: &#96;&#96;&#96; r devtools::install_github(\"yourusername/demopckg\") &#96;&#96;&#96; Delete the example for now. Make sure you knit your README.Rmd file when you update it and never edit the README.md file (that's just for github). 1.4 Creating a function Function definitions are saved in the R folder. You don't have to, but I like to save each function in its own file and name the file after the function. 1.4.1 Template function Create a new R script from the File menu (New File &gt; R Script). Paste the following template into your file: myfunction &lt;- function(arg1 = &quot;Change me&quot;) { arg1 } 1.4.2 Edit the function We're going to create a function that reports a p-value in APA style, named report_p. It will take two arguments, the p-value (p) and the number of digits to round to (digits). Replace myfunction with report_p and change the arguments. Should p have a default value? Should digits? The first thing we should do in the function is check whether p is less than 0.001, and if it is, return the value &quot;p &lt; .001&quot;. report_p &lt;- function(p) { if (p &lt; .001) return(&quot;p &lt; .001&quot;) } Once you call the return() function, your function stops running. If p is greater than 0.001, then we should round it to the specified number of digits, paste it after the string &quot;p = &quot;, and return it. So add an argument called digits and set the default value to 3. report_p &lt;- function(p, digits = 3) { if (p &lt; .001) return(&quot;p &lt; .001&quot;) p_round &lt;- round(p, digits) p_string &lt;- paste(&quot;p =&quot;, p_round) return(p_string) } Run your function and test it with a few different p-values and digits. Try report_p(0.01034). Does this look exactly like you expect? APA style omits the leading zero and pads the number out to three digits. We can do this by converting our rounded p-value into a character string, replacing the string &quot;0.&quot; with &quot;.&quot;, and making sure to pad the right side with enough zeros. The stringr package has useful functions for this. When you use R functions from a package (not base R), you normally load the package using the library() function. When you're developing your own package, you should preface every function with its package name and two colons instead, so in the code below we'll use stringr::str_replace() and stringr::str_pad(), not str_replace() and str_pad(). One function you can't preface with the package name is the pipe. While you're testing your function, load the pipe by typing library(magrittr) in the console. report_p &lt;- function(p, digits = 3) { if (p &lt; .001) return(&quot;p &lt; .001&quot;) p_round &lt;- round(p, digits) %&gt;% as.character() %&gt;% # omit leading zero for APA-style stringr::str_replace(&quot;0.&quot;, &quot;.&quot;) %&gt;% # pad right with zeros stringr::str_pad(digits+1, &quot;right&quot;, 0) p_string &lt;- paste(&quot;p =&quot;, p_round) return(p_string) } 1.4.3 Documentation Put your cursor somewhere on the first line of your function and choose Insert Roxygen Skeleton from the Code menu. Figure 1.1: Insert Roxygen Skeleton It will insert the following documentation before your function. #&#39; Title #&#39; #&#39; @param p #&#39; @param digits #&#39; #&#39; @return #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @examples The #' is special to roxygen2 documentation, which we'll enable below. This generates what you see in the Help viewer. Type ?mean into the console pane and have a look at the Help pane. The first line is the name of the function in title case The Description is the lines between the title and first @param The Useage is automatically generated The Arguments section is generated from the list of @paramargument Argument description... The Value section is the text after @return The Examples section is the text under @examples This block should include @export to make sure your function is available for users of your package (replace @export with @keywords internal The documentation for your report_p function should look something like below: #&#39; Report p-value #&#39; #&#39; Reports a p-value in APA style. #&#39; #&#39; @param p The p-value #&#39; @param digits The number of digits to round to (default = 3) #&#39; #&#39; @return A string with the format &quot;p = .040&quot; or &quot;p &lt; .001&quot; #&#39; @examples #&#39; #&#39; report_p(0.02018) # returns &quot;p = .020&quot; #&#39; report_p(0.00028) # returns &quot;p &lt; .001&quot; #&#39; #&#39; @export Save your file in the R directory with the name report_p.R. For now, we'll make a separate file for each function and give it the name of the function. Roxygen creates automatic documentation. You enable it with the following command (you only need to run this once per package). usethis::use_roxygen_md() Now you can automatically update the documentation for your package by running devtools::document(), after which you should see the following text. devtools::document() Updating demopckg documentation Writing NAMESPACE Loading demopckg Writing report_p.Rd You don't need to worry about these files, they'll be added to your package to show Help documentation. 1.4.4 Imports You need to &quot;import&quot; any packages you used in your function by running usethis::use_package for each package you want to include. usethis::use_package(&quot;stringr&quot;) You can't import the whole tidyverse, but you can import each package separately (i.e., ggplot2, purrr, tibble, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, readr, forcats). Import just the packages you actually need. If you use pipes (even if you've imported dplyr), you also need to run usethis::use_pipe(). It will add a file called utils-pipe.R to your R directory and add magrittr to your Imports. 1.5 Build your package Now you're ready to check and build your package for installation. 1.5.1 Check First, check everything by running devtools::check(). You'll get a lot of output, but don't worry unless you have an error message. Hopefully, you'll get this message: 0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 0 notes ✔ 1.5.2 Build Once you've fixed any errors, you can build your package. devtools::build() You'll get a message that looks like this: ✔ checking for file ‘/Users/lisad/rproj/demopckg/DESCRIPTION’ ... ─ preparing ‘demopckg’: ✔ checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... ─ checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts ─ checking for empty or unneeded directories ─ building ‘demopckg_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz’ [1] &quot;/Users/lisad/rproj/demopckg_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz&quot; 1.5.3 Install Next, install your new package with the following code (../ means to go up one directory to look for the demopckg install file). devtools::install(&quot;../demopckg&quot;) You'll see a bunch of output that should end in: * DONE (demopckg) 1.5.4 Test To make sure it's all gone well, restart R and try to use the function report_p(0.00039). You should get an error message. Then load your new package with library(demopckg) are retry the example above. Type ?report_p in the console and look at your Help documentation. Restart R and open a new .R or .Rmd file. Load your new package at the top of the file and try using your function in a paragraph that reports the p-value for a test. 1.6 Error checking Try running your function with different values for p. What happens if you use invalid values, like 1.07, -0.05, or &quot;A&quot;? We can add error checking to a function to quit and give a message if the error is fatal, or just warn them if the error is recoverable, but probably wrong. P-values can't ever be less than 0 or greater than 1, so we can just quit and give an error message if that happens. Add the following code to the beginning of your function, rerun the code to update the function, and test it on some values of p that are less than 0 or greater than 1. if (p &lt; 0) stop(&quot;p cannot be less than 0&quot;) if (p &gt; 1) stop(&quot;p cannot be greater than 1&quot;) What other errors do you think people might make? You can add checks to the beginning of your function to warn people if they don't enter reasonable numbers for the digits argument and set digits to the default value so that the code can continue. if (!(digits %in% 1:5)) { warning(&quot;digits should probably be an integer between 1 and 5&quot;) digits = 3 } 1.7 Unit tests Up until now, we've just tested our function in an ad hoc way every time we made changes. We can make this process more formal by using unit tests. These will make sure that your function is working properly if you make any changes. This seems like overkill for simple functions, but is absolutely essential for big projects, so best to get into good habits now. 1.7.1 Setup When you set up a new package, you need to set up the testing structure using usethis::use_testthat(). You only need to do this once for each package and you will know it has been done if a new directory called tests is made. 1.7.2 New unit tests Create a new test file for the report_p function using usethis::use_test(&quot;report_p&quot;). It will create a new file called test-report_p.R in the tests/testhat/ directory. Replace the text in that file with the text below. context(&quot;report_p&quot;) testthat::test_that(&quot;errors&quot;, { testthat::expect_error( report_p(-1), &quot;p cannot be less than 0&quot; ) testthat::expect_error( report_p(2), &quot;p cannot be greater than 1&quot; ) }) The context function lets you know what function you're testing when you run all the unit tests in a package. The test_that function checks a groups of expectations. The first set checks if we get the error messages we expect, so we've called it &quot;errors&quot;. We're going to check two expectations, that we'll get the error message &quot;p cannot be less than 0&quot; if p = -1, and that we'll get the error message &quot;p cannot be greater than 1&quot; id p = 2. You can test more values than these, but we'll start with just these two. After you save this file, run devtools::test(). You should see output like: Loading demopckg Testing demopckg ✔ | OK F W S | Context ✔ | 2 | report_p ══ Results ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ OK: 2 Failed: 0 Warnings: 0 Skipped: 0 Now add another testthat::test_that block called &quot;default values&quot;. Use the function testthat::expect_equal to check if the output of the report_p() function with different p values and the default digits value gives you the expected output. For example: testthat::expect_equal( report_p(p = 0.0222), &quot;p = .022&quot; ) 1.7.3 Run all tests Run devtools::test() after you add each test to make sure your tests work as expected. 1.8 Documentation Now it's time to edit your README to explain how to use your package. 1.8.1 Vignettes A vignette can also help users understand how to use your package. Create a new vignette with the function below. usethis::use_vignette(&quot;example&quot;) Change the YAML header to your &quot;Vignette Title&quot; and &quot;Vignette Author&quot; and edit the text below using R Markdown. 1.8.2 pkgdown The package pkgdown creates a website for your package. Run the following function to set it up. usethis::use_pkgdown() This will create a directory called docs and a file called _pkgdown.yml. Whenever you edit the documentation for new function, edit the README, or edit a vignette, you need to re-build the site. pkgdown::build_site() There will be a lot of output, then your site should automatically open up in your default web browser. 1.9 Share your package You can do package development without a GitHub account, but this is one of the easiest ways to share your package. 1.9.1 Git on RStudio If you don't have git installed on your computer, don't have it integrated with RStudio, and/or don't have a github account, follow the instructions in Appendix @ref(#git). 1.9.2 Set up git for this project If you aren't already using version control for this project, make sure all of your files are saved and type usethis::use_git() into the console. Choose Yes to commit and Yes to restart R. 1.9.3 GitHub access token Now set up a github access token with usethis::browse_github_pat(). Your web browser will open and you'll be asked to log into your github account and then asked to authorise a new token. Accept the defaults and click OK at the bottom of the page. Figure 1.2: Authorise a github token so you can create new github repositories from RStudio Copy your token (the whited-out bit in the image below). Figure 1.3: Copy your github token Type usethis::edit_r_environ() in the RStudio console pane. A new file called .Renviron will appear in the source pane. Add the following line to it (replace &lt;YOUR-TOKEN&gt; with your copied token). GITHUB_PAT=&lt;YOUR-TOKEN&gt; Save and close the file, then restart R. 1.9.4 Make a new GitHub repository Type usethis::use_github(protocol=&quot;https&quot;) into the console window and check that the suggested title and description are OK. ✔ Setting active project to &#39;/Users/lisad/rstuff/demopckg&#39; ● Check title and description Name: demopckg Description: Demo Stuff Are title and description ok? 1: No way 2: Yeah 3: No If you choose the affirmative response (not always #2), you'll see some messages and your web browser will open the github repsitory page. Figure 1.4: Your new github repository 1.9.5 Set up website Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to GitHub Pages. Set the Source to master branch/docs folder. Now you should be able to access your pkgdown website from https://username.github.io/demopkg/ (change to your username). Figure 1.5: Enable GitHub Pages 1.9.6 Install your package from GitHub Install your package using the following code (replacing username with your github username). devtools::install_github(&quot;username/demopckg&quot;) 1.10 Further resources There is a lot more to learn about package development, including writing vignettes to help users understand your functions and getting your package ready to submit to CRAN.

["aggregate.html", "Chapter 2 What's wrong with aggregating data?", " Chapter 2 What's wrong with aggregating data? library(tidyverse) library(lmerTest) library(faux) #devtools::install_github(&quot;debruine/faux&quot;) set.seed(90210) Imagine you want to find out if Armenian women born on an even-numbered day are taller than women born on an odd-numbered day. (I've chosen Armenian women because they're the first row in this paper.) First, let's simulate a group of 20 women born on even-numbered days and 20 women born on odd-numbered days. stim_n &lt;- 20 # height stats from https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018962 height_m &lt;- 158.1 height_sd &lt;- 5.7 stim &lt;- tibble( stim_id = 1:(stim_n*2), birthday = rep(c(&quot;odd&quot;, &quot;even&quot;), stim_n), height = rnorm(stim_n*2, height_m, height_sd) ) You can alternatively simulate this using a function from the faux package I'm developing. stim &lt;- sim_design(between = list(birthday = c(&quot;odd&quot;, &quot;even&quot;)), n = stim_n, mu = height_m, sd = height_sd, id = &quot;stim_id&quot;, dv = &quot;height&quot;, seed = 90210, plot = FALSE) Figure 2.1: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Obviously, the oddness of date of birth is not going to have any effect on women's actual height and a two-sample t-test confirms this. However, there is a small difference between the means of the groups just due to chance (2.73 cm). t.test(stim$height ~ stim$birthday) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: stim$height by stim$birthday ## t = 1.4959, df = 31.748, p-value = 0.1446 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.9883711 6.4472358 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group odd mean in group even ## 157.7036 154.9742 2.0.1 Measurement with Error But what if we don't measure height from each women once, but have a few different raters estimate it? The raters will each have their own bias, systematically overestimating or underestimating height on average. Let's simulate 20 raters who have biases with an SD of 2 cm. rater_n &lt;- 20 rater_bias_sd &lt;- 2 rater &lt;- tibble( rater_id = 1:rater_n, rater_bias = rnorm(rater_n, 0, rater_bias_sd) ) Again, you can also set up the simulated raters using faux's sim_design() function. rater &lt;- sim_design(n = rater_n, sd = rater_bias_sd, dv = &quot;rater_bias&quot;, id = &quot;rater_id&quot;, seed = 101, plot = FALSE) Figure 2.2: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! New we can get each rater to estimate the height of each woman. Their estimate is the woman's actual height, plus the rater's bias, plus some error (sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and an SD of 4 cm, since estimating height is hard). dat &lt;- expand.grid( rater_id = rater$rater_id, stim_id = stim$stim_id ) %&gt;% left_join(rater, by = &quot;rater_id&quot;) %&gt;% left_join(stim, by = &quot;stim_id&quot;) %&gt;% mutate( error = rnorm(nrow(.), 0, 4), estimate = height + rater_bias + error ) 2.0.2 Aggregating by stimuli You can aggregate by stimuli, that is, average the 20 raters' estimate for each stimulus. You now have 40 mean estimates that are fairly well-correlated with the women's actual heights. dat_agg_by_stim &lt;- dat %&gt;% group_by(stim_id, birthday, height) %&gt;% summarise(mean_estimate = mean(estimate)) Figure 2.3: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! You get pretty much the same result when you compare these mean estimates between the groups of women with odd and even birthdays. t.test(dat_agg_by_stim$mean_estimate ~ dat_agg_by_stim$birthday) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: dat_agg_by_stim$mean_estimate by dat_agg_by_stim$birthday ## t = 1.5779, df = 32.127, p-value = 0.1244 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.837759 6.600587 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group odd mean in group even ## 157.3599 154.4785 2.0.3 Aggregating by raters Alternatively, you can aggregate by raters, that is, average the 20 odd-group estimates and 20 even-group estimates for each rater. Now raters are your unit of analysis, so you've increased your power by having 20 raters and a within-subject design (each rater estimates heights for both odd- and even-birthday groups). dat_agg_by_rater &lt;- dat %&gt;% group_by(rater_id, birthday) %&gt;% summarise(mean_estimate = mean(estimate)) %&gt;% spread(birthday, mean_estimate) t.test(dat_agg_by_rater$odd, dat_agg_by_rater$even, paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: dat_agg_by_rater$odd and dat_agg_by_rater$even ## t = 12.196, df = 19, p-value = 1.971e-10 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 2.386903 3.375925 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## 2.881414 Now the difference between the odd- and even-birthday groups is highly significant! What's going is that you now have a relatively accurate estimate of the difference between the 20 women in the odd-birthday group and the 20 women in the even-birthday group. Since raters are the unit of analysis, this effect is likely to generalise to the larger population of potential raters, but only when they are rating these exact stimuli. Your conclusions cannot generalise beyond the stimulus set used here. While this seems like an obvious problem when the question is whether Armenian women with odd birthdays are taller or shorter than Armenian women with even birthdays, the problem is not so obvious for other questions, like whether boxers who won their last match have more masculine faces than boxers who lost their last match. The point of this tutorial isn't to call out any particular studies (I've certainly done this wrong myself plenty of times in the past), but to illustrate the enormous problem with this method and to explain the solution. 2.0.4 Mixed Effect Model In the particular case above, we're only interested in the between-stimulus main effect of birthday oddness. Therefore, aggregating by stimuli doesn't inflate your false positive rate, while aggregating by rater does. However, other designs might have increased false positives for aggregating by stimuli but not by rater, or when aggregating by either. A mixed effects model avoids the problems of aggregation completely by modelling random variation for both the stimuli and raters, as well as random variation in the size of within-group effects. You can generalise the conclusions of a mixed effects model to both the population of raters and the population of stimuli.

["sim-data.html", "Chapter 3 Simulating Data 3.1 Independent samples 3.2 Paired samples 3.3 Intercept model 3.4 Functions", " Chapter 3 Simulating Data This tutorial details a few ways I simulate data. I'll be using some functions from my faux package to make it easier to generate sets of variables with specific correlations. library(tidyverse) library(faux) # devtools::install_github(&quot;debruine/faux&quot;) set.seed(8675309) # this makes sure your script uses the same set of random numbers each time you run the full script (never set this inside a function or loop) 3.1 Independent samples Let's start with a simple independent-samples design where the variables are from a normal distribution. Each subject produces one score (in condition A or B). What we need to know about these scores is: How many subjects are in each condition? What are the score means? What are the score variances? 3.1.1 Parameters I start simulation scripts by setting parameters for these values. A_sub_n &lt;- 50 B_sub_n &lt;- 50 A_mean &lt;- 10 B_mean &lt;- 11 A_sd &lt;- 2.5 B_sd &lt;- 2.5 3.1.2 Scores We can the generate the scores using the rnorm() function. A_scores &lt;- rnorm(A_sub_n, A_mean, A_sd) B_scores &lt;- rnorm(B_sub_n, B_mean, B_sd) You can stop here and just analyse your simulated data with t.test(A_scores, B_scores), but usualy you want to get your simulated data into a data table that looks like what you might eventually import from a CSV file with your actual experimental data. I always use the tidyverse for data wrangling, so I'll create a data table using the tibble() function (but you can use data.frame() if you must). We need to know what condition each subject is in, so set the first A_sub_n values to &quot;A&quot; and the next B_sub_n values to &quot;B&quot;. Then set the score to the A_scores concatenated to the B_scores. dat &lt;- tibble( sub_condition = rep( c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), c(A_sub_n, B_sub_n) ), score = c(A_scores, B_scores) ) 3.1.3 Check your data Always examine your simulated data after you generate it to make sure it looks like you want. summary_dat &lt;- dat %&gt;% group_by(sub_condition) %&gt;% summarise(n = n() , mean = mean(score), sd = sd(score)) sub_condition n mean sd A 50 10.257 2.149 B 50 11.005 2.500 Your means and SDs won't be exactly what you specified because those parameters are for population and you are taking a sample. The larger your sub_n, the closer these values will usually be to the parameters you specify. 3.1.4 Analysis Now you can analyse your simulated data. t.test(score~sub_condition, dat) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: score by sub_condition ## t = -1.6044, df = 95.843, p-value = 0.1119 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.6735571 0.1774477 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group A mean in group B ## 10.25673 11.00478 3.1.5 Function You can wrap all this in a function so you can run it many times to do a power calculation. Put all your parameters as arguments to the function. ind_sim &lt;- function(A_sub_n, B_sub_n, A_mean, B_mean, A_sd, B_sd) { A_scores &lt;- rnorm(A_sub_n, A_mean, A_sd) B_scores &lt;- rnorm(B_sub_n, B_mean, B_sd) dat &lt;- tibble( sub_condition = rep( c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), c(A_sub_n, B_sub_n) ), score = c(A_scores, B_scores) ) t &lt;- t.test(score~sub_condition, dat) # return just the values you care about list( t = t$statistic, ci_lower = t$conf.int[1], ci_upper = t$conf.int[2], p = t$p.value, estimate = t$estimate[1] - t$estimate[2] ) } Now run your new function with the values you used above. ind_sim(50, 50, 10, 11, 2.5, 2.5) ## $t ## t ## -1.16975 ## ## $ci_lower ## [1] -1.56612 ## ## $ci_upper ## [1] 0.4052779 ## ## $p ## [1] 0.245173 ## ## $estimate ## mean in group A ## -0.5804213 Run the function with the parameters from the example above. Run it a few times and see how the results compare. What happens if you change a parameter? Edit the list at the end of the function to return more values of interest, like the means for A and B. Now you can use this function to run many simulations. There are a lot of ways to do this. The pattern below uses the map_df function from the purrr package. simulation &lt;- purrr::map_df(1:1000, ~ind_sim(50, 50, 10, 11, 2.5, 2.5)) The function map_df takes two arguments, a vector and a function, and returns a dataframe. It runs the function once for each item in the vector, so the vector 1:1000 above runs the ind_sim() function 1000 times. The purrr::map() functions can also set arguments in the function from the items in the vector. We aren't doing that here, but will use that pattern later. Now you can graph the data from your simulations. simulation %&gt;% gather(stat, value, t:estimate) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_density(aes(value, color = stat), show.legend = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~stat, scales = &quot;free&quot;) Figure 3.1: Distribution of results from simulated independent samples data You can calculate power as the proportion of simulations on which the p-value was less than your alpha. alpha &lt;- 0.05 power &lt;- mean(simulation$p &lt; alpha) Your power for the parameters above is 0.496. 3.2 Paired samples Now let's try a paired-samples design where the variables are from a normal distribution. Each subject produces two scores (in conditions A and B). What we need to know about these two scores is: How many subjects? What are the score means? What are the score variances? What is the correlation between the scores? 3.2.1 Parameters sub_n &lt;- 100 A_mean &lt;- 10 B_mean &lt;- 11 A_sd &lt;- 2.5 B_sd &lt;- 2.5 AB_r &lt;- 0.5 3.2.2 Correlated Scores You can then use rnorm_multi() to generate a data table with simulated values for correlated scores: dat &lt;- faux::rnorm_multi( n = sub_n, vars = 2, cors = AB_r, mu = c(A_mean, B_mean), sd = c(A_sd, B_sd), varnames = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ) ## Warning in faux::rnorm_multi(n = sub_n, vars = 2, cors = AB_r, mu = ## c(A_mean, : cors is deprecated, please use r 3.2.3 Check your data Now check your data; faux has a function get_params() that gives you the correlation table, means, and SDs for each numeric column in a data table. n var A B mean sd 100 A 1.00 0.51 9.81 2.29 100 B 0.51 1.00 10.81 2.57 3.2.4 Analysis Finally, you can analyse your simulated data. t.test(dat$A, dat$B, paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: dat$A and dat$B ## t = -4.1238, df = 99, p-value = 7.761e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.479129 -0.518129 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -0.9986288 3.2.5 Function The function is set up the same way as before.

This might seem excessively complicated, but you will need this pattern when you start simulating data for mixed effects models. 3.3.1 Parameters Remember, we used the following parameters to set up our simulation above: sub_n &lt;- 100 A_mean &lt;- 10 B_mean &lt;- 11 A_sd &lt;- 2.5 B_sd &lt;- 2.5 AB_r &lt;- 0.5 From these, we can calculate the grand intercept (the overall mean regardless of condition), and the effect of condition (the mean of B minus A). grand_i &lt;- (A_mean + B_mean)/2 AB_effect &lt;- B_mean - A_mean We also need to think about variance a little differently. First, calculate the pooled variance as the mean of the variances for A and B (remember, variance is SD squared). pooled_var &lt;- (A_sd^2 + B_sd^2)/2 If the SDs for A and B are very different, this suggests a more complicated data generation model. For this tutorial we'll assume the score variance is similar for conditions A and B. The variance of the subject intercepts is r times this pooled variance and the error variance is what is left over. We take the square root (sqrt()) to set the subject intercept and error SDs for simulation later. sub_sd &lt;- sqrt(pooled_var * AB_r) error_sd &lt;- sqrt(pooled_var * (1-AB_r)) You can think about the subject intercept variance as how much subjects vary in the score in general, regardless of condition. If they vary a lot, in comparison to the random &quot;error&quot; variation, then scores in the two conditions will be highly correlated. If they don't vary much (or random variation from trial to trial is quite large), then scores won't be well correlated. 3.3.2 Subject intercepts Now we use these variables to create a data table for our subjects. Each subject gets an ID and a random intercept (sub_i). The intercept is simulated from a random normal distribution with a mean of 0 and an SD of sub_sd. This represents how much higher or lower than the average score each subject tends to be (regardless of condition). sub &lt;- tibble( sub_id = 1:sub_n, sub_i = rnorm(sub_n, 0, sub_sd) ) 3.3.3 Observations Next, set up a table where each row represents one observation. We'll use one of my favourite functions for simulation: expand.grid(). This creates every possible combination of the listed factors. Here, we're using it to create a row for each subject in each condition, since this is a fully within-subjects design. obs &lt;- expand.grid( sub_id = 1:sub_n, condition = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ) 3.3.4 Calculate the score Next, we join the subject table so each row has the information about the subject's random intercept and then calculate the score. I've done it in a few steps below for clarity. The score is just the sum of: the overall mean (grand_i) the subject-specific intercept (sub_i) the effect of condition (-50% of AB_effect for condition A and +50% of AB_effect for condition B) the error term (simulated from a normal distribution with mean of 0 and SD of error_sd) dat &lt;- obs %&gt;% left_join(sub, by = &quot;sub_id&quot;) %&gt;% mutate( condition.e = recode(condition, &quot;A&quot; = -0.5, &quot;B&quot; = 0.5), effect = AB_effect * condition.e, error = rnorm(nrow(.), 0, error_sd), score = grand_i + sub_i + effect + error ) The variable condition.e &quot;effect codes&quot; condition, which we will use later in a mixed effect model. You can learn more about coding schemes here. You can use the following code to put the data table into a more familiar &quot;wide&quot; format. dat_wide &lt;- dat %&gt;% select(sub_id, condition, score) %&gt;% spread(condition, score) Then you can use the get_params function to check this looks correct (remove the subject ID to leave it out of the table, since it's numeric). n var A B mean sd 100 A 1.00 0.41 9.93 2.04 100 B 0.41 1.00 11.33 2.03 3.3.5 Analyses You can analyse the data with a paired-samples t-test from the wide format: t.test(dat_wide$A, dat_wide$B, paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: dat_wide$A and dat_wide$B ## t = -6.303, df = 99, p-value = 8.154e-09 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.8365839 -0.9571096 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -1.396847 Or in the long format: t.test(score ~ condition, dat, paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: score by condition ## t = -6.303, df = 99, p-value = 8.154e-09 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.8365839 -0.9571096 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -1.396847 You can analyse the data with ANOVA. afex::aov_4(score ~ (condition.e | sub_id), data = dat) ## Anova Table (Type 3 tests) ## ## Response: score ## Effect df MSE F ges p.value ## 1 condition.e 1, 99 2.46 39.73 *** .11 &lt;.0001 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;+&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 You can even analyse the data with a mixed effects model. lmem &lt;- lmerTest::lmer(score ~ condition.e + (1 | sub_id), data = dat) summary(lmem)$coefficients %&gt;% # nicer formatting with p-values as_tibble(rownames = &quot;Factor&quot;) %&gt;% mutate_if(~max(.) &lt; .001, ~as.character(signif(., 3))) %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits = 3) Factor Estimate Std.

I'll generate data for a Stroop task where people (subjects) say the colour of colour words (stimuli) shown in each of two versions (congruent and incongruent). Subjects are in one of two conditions (hard and easy). The dependent variable (DV) is reaction time. congruent: RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, PURPLE incongruent: RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, PURPLE We expect people to have faster reaction times for congruent stimuli than incongruent stimuli (main effect of version) and to be faster in the easy condition than the hard condition (main effect of condition). We'll look at some different interaction patterns below. 4.1 Setup We'll use the tidyverse to manipulate data frames and lmerTest (which includes lmer) to run the mixed effects models. I also like to set the scipen and digits options to get rid of scientific notation in lmer output. When you're simulating data, you should start your script by setting a seed. You can use any number you like, this just makes sure that you get the same results every time you run the script.

Each subject will have slightly faster or slower reaction times on average; this is their random intercept (sub_i). We'll model it from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and SD of 100ms. We also add between-subject variables here. Each subject is in only one condition, so assign half easy and half hard. Set the number of subjects as sub_n at the beginning so you can change this in the future with only one edit. sub_n &lt;- 200 # number of subjects in this simulation sub_sd &lt;- 100 # SD for the subjects&#39; random intercept sub &lt;- tibble( sub_id = 1:sub_n, sub_i = rnorm(sub_n, 0, sub_sd), # random intercept sub_cond = rep(c(&quot;easy&quot;,&quot;hard&quot;), each = sub_n/2) # between-subjects factor ) If you already have pilot data, you can estimate a realistic SD for the subjects' random intercepts using the following code. pilot_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;pilot_data.csv&quot;) pilot_mod &lt;- lmer(dv ~ 1 + (1 | sub_id) + (1 | stim_id), data = pilot_data) sub_sd &lt;- VarCorr(pilot_mod) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% filter(grp == &quot;sub_id&quot;) %&gt;% pull(sdcor) I like to check my simulations at every step with a graph. We expect subjects in hard and easy conditions to have approximately equal intercepts. ggplot(sub, aes(sub_i, color = sub_cond)) + geom_density() Figure 4.1: Double-check subject intercepts 4.2.2 Stimuli Now, we generate a sample of stimuli. Each stimulus will have slightly faster or slower reaction times on average; this is their random intercept (stim_i). We'll model it from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and SD of 50ms (it seems reasonable to expect less variability between words than people for this task). Stimulus version (congruent vs incongruent) is a within-stimulus variable, so we don't need to add it here. stim_n &lt;- 50 # number of stimuli in this simulation stim_sd &lt;- 50 # SD for the stimuli&#39;s random intercept stim &lt;- tibble( stim_id = 1:stim_n, stim_i = rnorm(stim_n, 0, stim_sd) # random intercept ) If you want to simulate data using the exact stimuli you already have pilot data for, you can calculate their random intercepts using the following code and use that instead of generating a random sample with the same SD. pilot_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;pilot_data.csv&quot;) pilot_mod &lt;- lmer(dv ~ 1 + (1 | sub_id) + (1 | stim_id), data = pilot_data) stim &lt;- ranef(pilot_mod)$stim_id %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &#39;stim_id&#39;) %&gt;% rename(stim_i = `(Intercept)`) Plot the random intercepts to double-check they look like you expect. ggplot(stim, aes(stim_i)) + geom_density() Figure 4.2: Double-check stimulus intercepts 4.2.3 Trials Now we put the subjects and stimuli together. In this study, all subjects respond to all stimuli in both upright and inverted versions, but subjects are in only one condition. The function expand.grid gives you a data frame with all possible combinations of the arguments. Add the data specific to each subject and stimulus by left joining the sub and stim data frames. trials &lt;- expand.grid( sub_id = sub$sub_id, # get subject IDs from the sub data table stim_id = stim$stim_id, # get stimulus IDs from the stim data table stim_version = c(&quot;congruent&quot;, &quot;incongruent&quot;) # all subjects see both congruent and incongruent versions of all stimuli ) %&gt;% left_join(sub, by = &quot;sub_id&quot;) %&gt;% # includes the intercept and conditin for each subject left_join(stim, by = &quot;stim_id&quot;) # includes the intercept for each stimulus Table 4.1: Subject- and stimulus-specific random intercepts for 2 subjects and 2 stimuli sub_id stim_id stim_version sub_i sub_cond stim_i 1 1 congruent -99.66 easy -4.418 2 1 congruent 72.18 easy -4.418 1 2 congruent -99.66 easy 4.057 2 2 congruent 72.18 easy 4.057 1 1 incongruent -99.66 easy -4.418 2 1 incongruent 72.18 easy -4.418 1 2 incongruent -99.66 easy 4.057 2 2 incongruent 72.18 easy 4.057 4.3 Calculate DV Now we can calculate the DV by adding together an overall intercept (mean RT for all trials), the subject-specific intercept, the stimulus-specific intercept, the effect of subject condition, the interaction between condition and version (set to 0 for this first example), the effect of stimulus version, and an error term. 4.3.1 Fixed effects We set these effects in raw units (ms) and effect-code the subject condition and stimulus version. It's usually easiest to interpret if you recode the level that you predict will be larger as +0.5 and the level you predict will be smaller as -0.5. So when we set the effect of subject condition (sub_cond_eff) to 50, that means the average difference between the easy and hard condition is 50ms. Easy is effect-coded as -0.5 and hard is effect-coded as +0.5, which means that trials in the easy condition have -0.5 * 50ms (i.e., -25ms) added to their reaction time, while trials in the hard condition have +0.5 * 50ms (i.e., +25ms) added to their reaction time. # set variables to use in calculations below grand_i &lt;- 400 # overall mean DV sub_cond_eff &lt;- 50 # mean difference between conditions: hard - easy stim_version_eff &lt;- 50 # mean difference between versions: incongruent - congruent cond_version_ixn &lt;- 0 # interaction between version and condition error_sd &lt;- 25 # residual (error) SD We set the error SD fairly low here so that it's easier to see how the parameters we set map onto the analysis output. You can calculate a realistic error SD from pilot data with the code below. pilot_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;pilot_data.csv&quot;) pilot_mod &lt;- lmer(dv ~ 1 + (1 | sub_id) + (1 | stim_id), data = pilot_data) error_sd &lt;- VarCorr(pilot_mod) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% filter(grp == &quot;Residual&quot;) %&gt;% pull(sdcor) The code chunk below effect-codes the condition and version factors (important for the analysis below), generates an error term for each trial, and generates the DV. dat &lt;- trials %&gt;% mutate( # effect-code subject condition and stimulus version sub_cond.e = recode(sub_cond, &quot;hard&quot; = -0.5, &quot;easy&quot; = +0.5), stim_version.e = recode(stim_version, &quot;congruent&quot; = -0.5, &quot;incongruent&quot; = +0.5), # calculate error term (normally distributed residual with SD set above) err = rnorm(nrow(.), 0, error_sd), # calculate DV from intercepts, effects, and error dv = grand_i + sub_i + stim_i + err + (sub_cond.e * sub_cond_eff) + (stim_version.e * stim_version_eff) + (sub_cond.e * stim_version.e * cond_version_ixn) # in this example, this is always 0 and could be omitted ) As always, graph to make sure you've simulated the general pattern you expected. ggplot(dat, aes(sub_cond, dv, color = stim_version)) + geom_hline(yintercept = grand_i) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) Figure 4.3: Double-check the simulated pattern Let's take a concrete example.

It can be easier to think about the simple main effects for each cell. Create four new variables and set them to the deviations from the overall mean you'd expect for each condition (so they should add up to 0). Here, we're simulating a small effect of version in the hard condition (50ms difference) and double that effect of version in the easy condition (100ms difference). # set variables to use in calculations below grand_i &lt;- 400 hard_congr &lt;- -25 hard_incon &lt;- +25 easy_congr &lt;- -50 easy_incon &lt;- +50 error_sd &lt;- 25 Use the code below to transform the simple main effects above into main effects and interactions for use in the equations below. # calculate main effects and interactions from simple effects above # mean difference between easy and hard conditions sub_cond_eff &lt;- (easy_congr + easy_incon)/2 - (hard_congr + hard_incon)/2 # mean difference between incongruent and congruent versions stim_version_eff &lt;- (hard_incon + easy_incon)/2 - (hard_congr + easy_congr)/2 # interaction between version and condition cond_version_ixn &lt;- (easy_incon - easy_congr) - (hard_incon - hard_congr) Then generate the DV the same way we did above, but also add the interaction effect multiplied by the effect-coded subject condition and stimulus version. dat &lt;- trials %&gt;% mutate( # effect-code subject condition and stimulus version sub_cond.e = recode(sub_cond, &quot;hard&quot; = -0.5, &quot;easy&quot; = +0.5), stim_version.e = recode(stim_version, &quot;congruent&quot; = -0.5, &quot;incongruent&quot; = +0.5), # calculate error term (normally distributed residual with SD set above) err = rnorm(nrow(.), 0, error_sd), # calculate DV from intercepts, effects, and error dv = grand_i + sub_i + stim_i + err + (sub_cond.e * sub_cond_eff) + (stim_version.e * stim_version_eff) + (sub_cond.e * stim_version.e * cond_version_ixn) ) ggplot(dat, aes(sub_cond, dv, color = stim_version)) + geom_hline(yintercept = grand_i) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) Figure 4.4: Double-check the interaction between condition and version Let's look at subject 1's reaction time to stimulus 1 in the congruent condition in more detail again.

First, let's reset the parameters we set above. sub_n &lt;- 200 # number of subjects in this simulation sub_sd &lt;- 100 # SD for the subjects&#39; random intercept stim_n &lt;- 50 # number of stimuli in this simulation stim_sd &lt;- 50 # SD for the stimuli&#39;s random intercept grand_i &lt;- 400 # overall mean DV sub_cond_eff &lt;- 50 # mean difference between conditions: hard - easy stim_version_eff &lt;- 50 # mean difference between versions: incongruent - congruent cond_version_ixn &lt;- 0 # interaction between version and condition error_sd &lt;- 25 # residual (error) SD 4.6.1 Subjects In addition to generating a random intercept for each subject, now we will also generate a random slope for any within-subject factors. The only within-subject factor in this design is stim_version. The main effect of stim_version is set to 50 above, but different subjects will show variation in the size of this effect. That's what the random slope captures. We'll set sub_version_sd below to the SD of this variation and use this to calculate the random slope (sub_version_slope) for each subject. Also, it's likely that the variation between subjects in the size of the effect of version is related in some way to between-subject variation in the intercept. So we want the random intercept and slope to be correlated. Here, we'll simulate a case where subjects who have slower (larger) reaction times across the board show a smaller effect of condition, so we set sub_i_version_cor below to a negative number (-0.2). I'm writing a package that has functions to easily create correlated variables for simulations. The function rnorm_multi generates n observations of vars variables with mu means and sd standard deviations with cors specific correlations. You can learn more about this function at my Simulating Multiple Vectors tutorial. You can use devtools::install_github(&quot;debruine/faux&quot;) to install the package. The code below creates two variables (sub_i, sub_version_slope) that are correlated with r = -0.2, means of 0, and SDs equal to what we set sub_sd above and sub_version_sd below. sub_version_sd &lt;- 20 sub_i_version_cor &lt;- -0.2 sub &lt;- rnorm_multi( n = sub_n, vars = 2, cors = sub_i_version_cor, mu = 0, # means of random intercepts and slopes are always 0 sd = c(sub_sd, sub_version_sd), varnames = c(&quot;sub_i&quot;, &quot;sub_version_slope&quot;) ) %&gt;% mutate( sub_id = 1:sub_n, sub_cond = rep(c(&quot;easy&quot;,&quot;hard&quot;), each = sub_n/2) # between-subjects factor ) ## Warning in rnorm_multi(n = sub_n, vars = 2, cors = sub_i_version_cor, mu = ## 0, : cors is deprecated, please use r Plot to double-check it looks sensible. ggplot(sub, aes(sub_i, sub_version_slope, color = sub_cond)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) Figure 4.7: Double-check slope-intercept correlations 4.6.2 Stimuli In addition to generating a random intercept for each stimulus, we will also generate a random slope for any within-stimulus factors. Both stim_version and sub_condition are within-stimulus factors (i.e., all stimuli are seen in both congruent and incongruent versions and both easy and hard conditions). So the main effects of version and condition (and their interaction) will vary depending on the stimulus. They will also be correlated, but in a more complex way than above. You need to set the correlations for all pairs of slopes and intercept. Let's set the correlation between the random intercept and each of the slopes to -0.4 and the slopes all correlate with each other +0.2 (You could set each of the six correlations separately if you want, though). See the Simulating Multiple Vectors tutorial for other ways to set the correlations. stim_version_sd &lt;- 10 # SD for the stimuli&#39;s random slope for stim_version stim_cond_sd &lt;- 30 # SD for the stimuli&#39;s random slope for sub_cond stim_cond_version_sd &lt;- 15 # SD for the stimuli&#39;s random slope for sub_cond:stim_version stim_i_cor &lt;- -0.4 # correlations between intercept and slopes stim_s_cor &lt;- +0.2 # correlations among slopes # specify correlations for rnorm_multi (one of several methods) stim_cors &lt;- c(stim_i_cor, stim_i_cor, stim_i_cor, stim_s_cor, stim_s_cor, stim_s_cor) stim &lt;- rnorm_multi( n = stim_n, vars = 4, cors = stim_cors, mu = 0, # means of random intercepts and slopes are always 0 sd = c(stim_sd, stim_version_sd, stim_cond_sd, stim_cond_version_sd), varnames = c(&quot;stim_i&quot;, &quot;stim_version_slope&quot;, &quot;stim_cond_slope&quot;, &quot;stim_cond_version_slope&quot;) ) %&gt;% mutate( stim_id = 1:stim_n ) ## Warning in rnorm_multi(n = stim_n, vars = 4, cors = stim_cors, mu = 0, sd = ## c(stim_sd, : cors is deprecated, please use r Here, we're simulating different SDs for different effects, so our plot should reflect this.

You specify random slopes by adding the within-level effects to the random intercept specifications. Since the only within-subject factor is version, the random effects specification for subjects is (1 + stim_version.e | sub_id). Since both condition and version are within-stimuli factors, the random effects specification for stimuli is (1 + stim_version.e*sub_cond.e | stim_id). Keep It Maximal is a great paper on how and why to set random slopes maximally like this. This model will take a lot longer to run than one without random slopes specified. mod &lt;- lmer(dv ~ sub_cond.e * stim_version.e + (1 + stim_version.e | sub_id) + (1 + stim_version.e*sub_cond.e | stim_id), data = dat) ## Warning in checkConv(attr(opt, &quot;derivs&quot;), opt$par, ctrl = ## control$checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.0132569 ## (tol = 0.002, component 1) mod.sum &lt;- summary(mod) mod.sum ## Linear mixed model fit by REML. t-tests use Satterthwaite&#39;s method [ ## lmerModLmerTest] ## Formula: ## dv ~ sub_cond.e * stim_version.e + (1 + stim_version.e | sub_id) + ## (1 + stim_version.e * sub_cond.e | stim_id) ## Data: dat ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 188357 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -4.799 -0.661 -0.007 0.657 3.788 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

You can ignore those for now. Click on the docs directory in the Files tab of the lower right pane Click on index.html and choose View in Web Browser Check if your links work, edit and repeat if they don't 5.3 Add content If you are comfortable with HTML, you can write most of your page in HTML. If not, I'd suggest using rmarkdown, whcih is a simple way to indicate headings, paragraphs, links, lists and images. 5.3.1 Headings and paragraphs Headings are prefaces with hashes #. The largest, title heading gets one hash and each subheading level adds another hash. Paragraphs don't require any special marks, they are just automatically created when you skip a line between blocks of text. ### Headings and paragraphs Headings are prefaces with hashes `#`. The largest, title heading gets one hash and each subheading level adds another hash. Paragraphs don&#39;t require any special marks, they are just automatically created when you skip a line between blocks of text. 5.3.2 Links Links are just text surrounded by square brackets, followed by the URL surrounded by parentheses. Start the URL with http:// if it's an external website. If you want to link to one of your own pages, you can just put the name of the page. I can link to Google or to my own main page. I can link to [Google](http://google.com) or to [my own main page](index.html). 5.3.3 Lists You can make bullet point lists by prefacing items with * or numeric lists by prefacing them with numbers. Make nested lists by indenting 4 spaces.

You can use incrementing numbers if you want, but using all 1s makes it easier to change the order of your items with out having the renumber. 5.3.4 Images Images are created much like links. Just put an exclamation mark (!) before the first brasket and put some explanatory text (title and image credit) in the squre brackets, and the image location in the parentheses.

You can use default, cerulean, journal, flatly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, and yeti. Annoyingly, there are no dark themes available by default. name: &quot;mywebpage&quot; author: &quot;YOUR NAME&quot; output_dir: &quot;docs&quot; output: html_document: self_contained: no theme: flatly css: style.css navbar: title: &quot;My First Webpage&quot; 5.5.2 Add custom styles You can also add a custom style sheet (a document that determines how each element of your website should look) by adding the line css: style.css under html_document: in the _site.yml file (as above). Then you need to create a file named style.css and add your custom styles there. The web has thousands of guides to CSS, but codeacademy has great interactive tutorials for learning html, css, and even more advanced web coding like javascript. However, the basics of css are easy to learn and it's best to just start playing around with it. Add the following text to your style.css file and re-render the website using rmarkdown::render_site(). 5.5.3 Change global fonts and colours html { font-size: 2em; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: white; background-color: hsl(360, 100%, 20%); } #html-example * { font-size: 2em; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; color: white; background-color: hsl(300, 100%, 20%); } This will make all the text on your website twice as large, a different font, and change the text and background colours. 5.5.4 Change certain elements Maybe you only want to change the font colour for your headings, not the rest of the text. You can apply a style to a specific element type by specifying the element name before the curly brackets. h1, h2, h3 { text-align: center; color: hsl(0, 100%, 20%); } h3 { font-style: italic; } p { border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px; line-height: 2; } ul { border: 3px dotted red; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 30px; } #h-example h2, #h-example h3, #h-example h4 { text-align: center; color: hsl(0, 100%, 20%); } #h-example h4 { font-style: italic; } #h-example p { border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px; line-height: 2; } #h-example ul { border: 3px dotted red; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 30px; } 5.5.4 Example using the styles above The CSS above changes the styles for three levels of headers (h2, h3, h4) and sets the third level to italics. 5.5.4 Level 3 header It also gives paragraphs (p) a green border and double-spacing. 5.5.4 Level 4 header Unordered Lists (ul) get: dotted red border round corners increased padding on top (10px) and sides (30px) 5.6 Put your webpage online 5.6.1 Save this version with git Click on the git tab in the upper right pane Stage your files Select all (cmd-A) and click on a checkbox in the Staged column to select all files Commit your changes Click Commit.

["pipes.html", "C Pipes", " C Pipes Pipes are a way to order your code in a more readable format. Let's say you have a small data table with 10 participant IDs, two columns with variable type A, and 2 columns with variable type B. You want to calculate the mean of the A variables and the mean of the B variables and return a table with 10 rows (1 for each participant) and 3 columns (id, A_mean and B_mean). One way you could do this is by creating a new object at every step and using that object in the next step. This is pretty clear, but you've created 6 unnecessary data objects in your environment. This can get confusing in very long scripts. library(tidyverse) # make a data table with 10 subjects data_original &lt;- tibble( id = 1:10, A1 = rnorm(10, 0), A2 = rnorm(10, 1), B1 = rnorm(10, 2), B2 = rnorm(10, 3) ) # gather columns A1 to B2 into &quot;variable&quot; and &quot;value&quot; columns data_gathered &lt;- gather(data_original, variable, value, A1:B2) # separate the variable column at the _ into &quot;var&quot; and &quot;var_n&quot; columns data_separated &lt;- separate(data_gathered, variable, c(&quot;var&quot;, &quot;var_n&quot;), sep = 1) # group the data by id and var data_grouped &lt;- group_by(data_separated, id, var) # calculate the mean value for each id/var data_summarised &lt;- summarise(data_grouped, mean = mean(value)) # spread the mean column into A and B columns data_spread &lt;- spread(data_summarised, var, mean) # rename A and B to A_mean and B_mean data &lt;- rename(data_spread, A_mean = A, B_mean = B) id A_mean B_mean 1 0.8235115 2.610212 2 0.4313228 2.915915 3 0.5164183 1.947431 4 0.3280787 3.955934 5 0.2868058 2.199072 6 1.1814350 1.097234 7 1.3525597 1.629652 8 0.3568709 1.327212 9 -0.0509808 2.965090 10 -0.1822209 0.295115 You can name each object data and keep replacing the old data object with the new one at each step. This will keep you environment clean, but I don't recommend it because it makes it too easy to accidentally run your code out of order when you are running line-by-line for development or debugging. One way to avoid extra objects is to nest your functions, literally replacing each data object with the code that generated it in the previous step. This can be fine for very short chains. mean_petal_width &lt;- round(mean(iris$Petal.Width), 2) But it gets extremely confusing for long chains: # do not ever do this!! data &lt;- rename( spread( summarise( group_by( separate( gather( tibble( id = 1:10, A1 = rnorm(10, 0), A2 = rnorm(10, 1), B1 = rnorm(10, 2), B2 = rnorm(10, 3)), variable, value, A1:B2), variable, c(&quot;var&quot;, &quot;var_n&quot;), sep = 1), id, var), mean = mean(value)), var, mean), A_mean = A, B_mean = B) The pipe lets you &quot;pipe&quot; the result of each function into the next function, allowing you to put your code in a logical order without creating too many extra objects. # calculate mean of A and B variables for each participant data &lt;- tibble( id = 1:10, A1 = rnorm(10, 0), A2 = rnorm(10, 1), B1 = rnorm(10, 2), B2 = rnorm(10, 3) ) %&gt;% gather(variable, value, A1:B2) %&gt;% separate(variable, c(&quot;var&quot;, &quot;var_n&quot;), sep=1) %&gt;% group_by(id, var) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(value)) %&gt;% spread(var, mean) %&gt;% rename(A_mean = A, B_mean = B) You can read this code from top to bottom as follows: Make a tibble called data with id of 1 to 10, A1 of 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 0, A2 of 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 1, B1 of 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 2, B2 of 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 3; and then Gather to create variable and value column from columns A_1 to B_2; and then Separate the column variable into 2 new columns called varand var_n, separate at character 1; and then Group by columns id and var; and then Summarise and new column called mean as the mean of the value column for each group; and then Spread to make new columns with the key names in var and values in mean; and then Rename to make columns called A_mean (old A) and B_mean (old B) You can make intermediate objects whenever you need to break up your code because it's getting too complicated or you need to debug something. You can debug a pipe by running just the first few functions by highlighting from the beginning to just before the pipe you want to stop at. Try this by highlighting from data &lt;- to the end of the separate function and typing cmd-return. What does data look like now? "],
